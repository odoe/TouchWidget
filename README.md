# ArcGIS JavaScript TouchWidget
This is a widget to add some user feedback functionality for [ArcGIS JavaScript](http://developers.arcgis.com/en/javascript/) applications used on mobile or tablet devices. The biggest complaint I get from users is they can't always tell where they clicked on a map. This widget will simply add a graphic to the map where a user clicks and then fade it out.
