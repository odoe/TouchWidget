# ArcGIS JavaScript TouchWidget

----
This is a widget to add some graphical feedback functionality for [ArcGIS JavaScript](http://developers.arcgis.com/en/javascript/) applications used on mobile or tablet devices.

One of my gripes is can't always tell when I click on a map. This widget will simply add a graphic to the map where a user clicks and then fade it out.

Demo can be seen [here.](http://www.odoe.net/thelab/js/touch/)

*A work in progress*
